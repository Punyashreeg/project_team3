📚 Online Bookstore - Cart

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project for an Online Bookstore that lets users browse books, add them to a shopping cart, remove books, and checkout.
The cart data is stored in the browser’s localStorage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

🚀 Features

Book Catalog: Displays a list of 30 books with titles, prices, and images.

Add to Cart: Click the Add to Cart button to add books to your cart.

Remove from Cart: Easily remove items from the cart.

Cart Persistence: Cart items are saved in localStorage so they are not lost on page reload.

Checkout: Shows total amount and clears the cart after purchase.

Responsive Grid Layout (with improved CSS).


🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the website.

CSS3 – Styling for layout, buttons, and book cards.

JavaScript – Cart functionality and localStorage integration.
